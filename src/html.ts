If this keyword is not used, the popup will silently fail to open. allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox: Lets the sandboxed document open new windows without those windows inheriting the sandboxing. For example, this can safely sandbox an advertisement without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to. allow-presentation: Lets the resource start a presentation session. allow-same-origin: If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy (potentially preventing access to data storage/cookies and some JavaScript APIs). allow-scripts: Lets the resource run scripts (but not create popup windows). allow-storage-access-by-user-activation : Lets the resource request access to the parent's storage capabilities with the Storage Access API. allow-top-navigation: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the one named _top). allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture. Notes about sandboxing: When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is strongly discouraged to use both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin, as that lets the embedded document remove the sandbox attribute — making it no more secure than not using the sandbox attribute at all. Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed iframe — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a separate origin to limit potential damage. The sandbox attribute is unsupported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier.

There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an `<input>` element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector("form"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements["hat-size"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input.

The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in other algorithms). The value must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping — the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have `<input type="number" min="10" step="2">`, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, `<input type="number">`, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as `<input type="number" min="-5.2">` Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass.
